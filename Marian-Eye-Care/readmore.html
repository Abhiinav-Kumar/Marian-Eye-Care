                                        <p class="card-text">Cataracts are a clouding of the eye's natural lens, leading to blurry or hazy vision that can worsen over time, potentially causing vision loss if left untreated, and are often related to aging. 
                                            <br><br>
                                            <strong>What are cataracts? </strong><br>
                                            A cataract is a condition where the normally clear lens of the eye becomes cloudy. 
                                            The lens is responsible for focusing light onto the retina, and a cloudy lens disrupts this process, leading to blurry or hazy vision. 
                                            Cataracts are a common cause of vision loss, especially in older adults. <br><br>

                                            <strong>Causes and Risk Factors:</strong> <br>
                                            Age: The most common cause of cataracts is age-related changes in the lens. <br>
                                            Other factors: <br>
                                            Diabetes: People with diabetes are at higher risk for cataracts. <br>
                                            Medications: Certain medications, like corticosteroids, can increase the risk. <br>
                                            Eye injuries: Injuries to the eye can lead to cataracts. <br>
                                            Exposure to radiation: Exposure to certain types of radiation, like UV light, can contribute to cataract development. <br><br>
                                            <strong>Symptoms:</strong> <br>
                                            Blurred or hazy vision: The most common symptom is a gradual blurring or haziness of vision. <br>
                                            Difficulty seeing at night: Cataracts can make it harder to see in low-light conditions. <br> 
                                            Sensitivity to light and glare: Some people with cataracts may experience increased sensitivity to light and glare. <br>
                                            Faded colors: Colors may appear less vibrant or faded. <br>
                                            Double vision in one eye: In some cases, cataracts can cause double vision in the affected eye.

                                        <p class="card-text">Glaucoma is a group of eye conditions that damage the optic nerve, potentially leading to vision loss or blindness, often due to increased pressure inside the eye. Early detection and treatment can help preserve vision, though there's no cure. 
                                            <br><br>
                                            <strong>What is Glaucoma?</strong><br>
                                            Damage to the Optic Nerve:
                                            Glaucoma damages the optic nerve, which transmits visual information from the eye to the brain. <br>
                                            Increased Eye Pressure:
                                            This damage is often linked to increased pressure inside the eye, known as intraocular pressure. <br>
                                            Vision Loss:
                                            If left untreated, glaucoma can lead to progressive vision loss and even blindness. <br> 
                                            Second Leading Cause of Blindness:
                                            Glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness worldwide. <br><br>
                                            <strong>Types of Glaucoma:</strong>
                                            Open-Angle Glaucoma:
                                            The most common type, where the fluid in the eye doesn't drain properly, leading to a gradual increase in pressure. 
                                            Angle-Closure Glaucoma:
                                            A more serious type where the iris (colored part of the eye) blocks the fluid's drainage, causing a sudden and severe increase in pressure. 
                                            Other Types:
                                            Include congenital glaucoma (present at birth), neovascular glaucoma (due to new blood vessel growth), and pigmentary glaucoma. <br><br>
                                            <strong>Symptoms:</strong>
                                            Early Stages:
                                            Often, glaucoma has no noticeable symptoms in the early stages, which is why early detection is crucial. <br>
                                            Later Stages:
                                            As the disease progresses, symptoms can include:
                                            Loss of peripheral (side) vision. <br>
                                            Halos around lights. <br>
                                            Eye pain (especially in angle-closure glaucoma). <br>
                                            Nausea and vomiting (in acute angle-closure glaucoma). <br>
                                            Blurry or foggy vision. <br>
                                            Redness of the eye. </p>

                                        Conjunctivitis, commonly known as pink eye, is an inflammation or infection of the conjunctiva — the thin, transparent tissue that lines the inner surface of the eyelid and covers the white part of the eye. It can affect one or both eyes and is often highly contagious.
                                        <br><br>
                                        
                                        <strong>What is Conjunctivitis?</strong><br>
                                        Inflammation of the Conjunctiva:
                                        Conjunctivitis occurs when the conjunctiva becomes irritated or infected, causing redness, swelling, and discomfort. <br>
                                        Highly Contagious (in most cases):
                                        It can spread easily through direct or indirect contact with the infected person's eye secretions. <br>
                                        Can Affect All Ages:
                                        Though common in children, conjunctivitis can affect individuals of all age groups. <br>
                                        Not Usually Serious:
                                        Most cases are mild and resolve without long-term effects if treated promptly. <br><br>
                                        
                                        <strong>Types of Conjunctivitis:</strong><br>
                                        Viral Conjunctivitis:
                                        Caused by viruses (like those that cause the common cold); highly contagious and often spreads through coughing or sneezing. <br>
                                        Bacterial Conjunctivitis:
                                        Caused by bacteria and may produce thick eye discharge; also contagious. <br>
                                        Allergic Conjunctivitis:
                                        Triggered by allergens like pollen, dust, or pet dander; not contagious. <br>
                                        Irritant Conjunctivitis:
                                        Caused by exposure to smoke, chemicals, or foreign bodies in the eye. <br><br>
                                        
                                        <strong>Symptoms:</strong><br>
                                        Red or pink color in the white of the eye(s). <br>
                                        Increased tear production. <br>
                                        Itchy, burning, or gritty feeling in the eye(s). <br>
                                        Discharge from the eye(s) that may form a crust during sleep. <br>
                                        Swollen eyelids. <br>

                                        Retinal Detachment is a serious eye condition where the retina — the thin layer of tissue at the back of the eye — pulls away from its normal position. This separation prevents the retina from functioning properly, potentially leading to permanent vision loss if not treated promptly.

                                        <strong>What is Retinal Detachment?</strong><br>
                                        Separation of the Retina:  
                                        The retina detaches from the underlying tissue that supplies it with oxygen and nutrients, disrupting vision. <br>
                                        Medical Emergency:  
                                        Retinal detachment is an emergency that requires immediate medical attention to prevent permanent vision loss. <br>
                                        Not Typically Painful:  
                                        It usually occurs without pain, which is why recognizing the warning signs is crucial. <br><br>
                                    
                                        <strong>Types of Retinal Detachment:</strong><br>
                                        Rhegmatogenous Retinal Detachment:  
                                        The most common type, caused by a tear or break in the retina allowing fluid to get underneath. <br>
                                        Tractional Retinal Detachment:  
                                        Occurs when scar tissue on the retina's surface contracts and pulls the retina away. <br>
                                        Exudative Retinal Detachment:  
                                        Caused by fluid buildup under the retina without a tear, often due to inflammation, injury, or tumors. <br><br>
                                    
                                        <strong>Symptoms:</strong><br>
                                        Sudden appearance of floaters (tiny specks or threads drifting in your vision). <br>
                                        Flashes of light in one or both eyes. <br>
                                        A shadow or curtain over a portion of your visual field. <br>
                                        Blurred or reduced vision. <br>
                                        Loss of peripheral (side) vision. <br>
                                        Prompt treatment can often restore lost vision or prevent further loss. <br>

                                        Diabetic Retinopathy is a diabetes-related eye condition that affects the blood vessels of the retina, the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye. It can lead to vision problems and even blindness if left untreated, but early detection and proper diabetes management can help prevent serious complications.

                                        Retina Damage Due to Diabetes:  
                                        High blood sugar levels can damage the tiny blood vessels in the retina, leading to leakage, swelling, or abnormal blood vessel growth. <br>
                                        Progressive Condition:  
                                        Diabetic Retinopathy usually develops over time and may not show symptoms in the early stages. <br>
                                        Can Lead to Vision Loss:  
                                        If not treated, it can cause severe vision impairment or blindness. <br>
                                        Common Among Diabetic Patients:  
                                        It is one of the most common complications of diabetes, affecting both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetics. <br><br>

                                        Early stage where small blood vessels leak fluid or blood, causing the retina to swell. <br>
                                        Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy (PDR):  
                                        Advanced stage where abnormal new blood vessels grow on the retina, which can bleed or lead to retinal detachment. <br><br>
                                    
                                        <strong>Symptoms:</strong><br>

                                        Refractive Errors are common vision problems that occur when the shape of the eye prevents light from focusing correctly on the retina. These errors cause blurry vision and are usually corrected with glasses, contact lenses, or refractive surgery.

                                        <strong>What are Refractive Errors?</strong><br>
                                        Improper Light Focus:  
                                        Light entering the eye doesn’t focus properly on the retina, resulting in blurred or distorted vision. <br>
                                        Not an Eye Disease:  
                                        Refractive errors are not diseases, but rather optical conditions related to the shape of the eye. <br>
                                        Easily Correctable:  
                                        Most refractive errors can be corrected with prescription eyewear or laser vision correction. <br><br>
                                    
                                        <strong>Types of Refractive Errors:</strong><br>
                                        Myopia (Nearsightedness):  
                                        Distant objects appear blurry because light focuses in front of the retina. <br>
                                        Hyperopia (Farsightedness):  
                                        Close objects appear blurry because light focuses behind the retina. <br>
                                        Astigmatism:  
                                        Caused by an irregularly shaped cornea or lens, leading to distorted or blurred vision at all distances. <br>

                                    <p class="card-text">
                                        Amblyopia, commonly known as lazy eye, is a vision development disorder where one eye fails to achieve normal visual acuity, even with prescription glasses or contact lenses. It usually begins during infancy or early childhood and can lead to permanent vision problems if not treated early.
                                        <br><br>
                                    
                                        <strong>What is Amblyopia?</strong><br>
                                        Reduced Vision in One Eye:  
                                        The brain favors one eye over the other, causing the weaker eye to become "lazy" and underused. <br>
                                        Not Due to Structural Issues:  
                                        Amblyopia is not caused by any eye disease or structural abnormality, but by poor coordination between the brain and the affected eye. <br>
                                        Early Detection is Critical:  
                                        If diagnosed and treated early, vision can often be significantly improved. <br><br>
                                    
                                        <strong>Causes of Amblyopia:</strong><br>
                                        Strabismic Amblyopia:  
                                        Caused by misalignment of the eyes (strabismus), where the brain ignores input from the misaligned eye. <br>
                                        Refractive Amblyopia:  
                                        Due to unequal refractive errors in the two eyes, leading the brain to rely on the clearer image from one eye. <br>
                                        Deprivation Amblyopia:  
                                        Occurs when something blocks vision in one eye during early development (e.g., cataract). <br><br>
                                    
                                        <strong>Symptoms:</strong><br>
                                        Poor depth perception. <br>
                                        Squinting or shutting one eye. <br>
                                        Head tilting. <br>
                                        Eyes that don’t appear to work together. <br>
                                        Wandering eye (in some cases). <br>
                                        Vision screening is important in young children, as symptoms may be subtle. <br>

                                        Blepharitis is a common and often chronic inflammation of the eyelids, particularly at the base of the eyelashes. It can cause irritation, redness, itching, and crusting, and may affect people of all ages. While not usually serious, it can be uncomfortable and may lead to more severe eye problems if left untreated.

                                        <strong>What is Blepharitis?</strong><br>
                                        Inflammation of the Eyelid Margins:  
                                        Blepharitis involves swelling and irritation around the eyelids, often due to clogged oil glands near the lash line. <br>
                                        Not Contagious:  
                                        Though uncomfortable, it is not typically contagious. <br>
                                        Can Be Ongoing:  
                                        It is often a chronic condition with flare-ups that require long-term care and hygiene. <br><br>
                                    
                                        <strong>Types of Blepharitis:</strong><br>
                                        Anterior Blepharitis:  
                                        Affects the front of the eyelid where the eyelashes grow; often linked to bacterial infections or skin conditions like dandruff. <br>
                                        Posterior Blepharitis:  
                                        Affects the inner edge of the eyelid and is typically related to dysfunction of the meibomian (oil) glands. <br><br>
                                    
                                        <strong>Symptoms:</strong><br>
                                        Red, swollen, or itchy eyelids. <br>
                                        Crusty or greasy eyelashes, especially in the morning. <br>
                                        Burning or stinging sensation in the eyes. <br>
                                        Watery or dry eyes. <br>
                                        Sensitivity to light. <br>
                                        Blurred vision (in severe cases). <br>

                                        Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) is a progressive eye condition that affects the macula — the central part of the retina responsible for sharp, detailed vision. It is one of the leading causes of vision loss in older adults, especially those over 50.
                                        <br><br>
                                    
                                        <strong>What is Age-Related Macular Degeneration?</strong><br>
                                        Central Vision Loss:  
                                        AMD affects central vision, which is essential for reading, driving, recognizing faces, and seeing fine details. <br>
                                        Damage to the Macula:  
                                        The macula deteriorates with age, leading to blurry or distorted vision. Peripheral vision usually remains unaffected. <br>
                                        Gradual or Sudden Onset:  
                                        The condition can progress slowly over time or more rapidly, depending on the type of AMD. <br><br>
                                    
                                        <strong>Types of AMD:</strong><br>
                                        Dry AMD (Atrophic):  
                                        The more common form, caused by thinning of the macula and the presence of drusen (tiny yellow deposits). Progresses slowly over time. <br>
                                        Wet AMD (Neovascular):  
                                        Less common but more severe. Caused by abnormal blood vessel growth under the retina, which can leak fluid or blood and cause rapid vision loss. <br><br>
                                    
                                        <strong>Symptoms:</strong><br>
                                        Blurred or fuzzy central vision. <br>
                                        Straight lines appearing wavy or distorted. <br>
                                        Difficulty reading or recognizing faces. <br>
                                        A dark or empty area in the center of vision. <br>
                                        Colors appearing less vivid. <br>
                                        Vision loss in one or both eyes. <br>
                                        Regular eye exams are important for early detection and management. <br>
